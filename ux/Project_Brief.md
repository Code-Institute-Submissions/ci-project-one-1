## Create a Website for a Band

Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper).

*"The band is an 80s inspired cinematic synth-pop band from California and have recently gained international recognition by millions of music streams online. They also announced and quickly sold out the vinyl print of their most popular album."*

**You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the clientâ€™s representatives:**

- Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalogue, and any new material as it becomes available.
- Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music, videos, photography, and publicise the upcoming events.
- Sell their music using 'Bandcamp' widgets.
- Latest music and events subscription by email.

**The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:**

- Photography
- Bandcamp audio tracks
- YouTube video clips
- SoundCloud audio clips

Also, they would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter, Bandcamp, SoundCloud and Instagram pages.
